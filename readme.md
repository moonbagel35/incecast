> [!WARNING]  
> @discordjs/voice currently does not support ARM64 architecture. Tested to work on an AMD64 architecture.

## Forked from okdargy's incecast

## Features
- 📻 Listen to radio streams
- 🔍 Search for radios (from [radio.garden API](https://radio.garden))
- 💬 Project current playing song to bot status

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/okdargy/incecast
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Install `ffmpeg`

This step is required for @discordjs/voice to work. You can install ffmpeg from [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We recommend you **not** to use ffmpeg-static as it is very unstable is almost guaranteed to crash.

4. Rename the `config.example.json` file to `config.json` and fill in the required fields.
```json
{
    "token": "",
    "clientId": "",
    "guildId": "",
    "defaultStream": ""
}
```

5. Deploy the commands
> This will deploy to only the server in the `guildId` variable
```bash
node deploy.js
```

6. Start the bot
```bash
node index.js
```
